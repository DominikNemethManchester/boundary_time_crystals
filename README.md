# boundary_time_crystals

This repository contains the code used in the paper:

**"Solving boundary time crystals via the superspin method"**  
by Dominik Németh, Alessandro Principi and Ahsan Nazir 2025.

It includes a Jupyter notebook to reproduce the key analytical and numerical results presented in the paper.  
Specifically, the code computes the Liouvillian spectrum, evaluates observables like ⟨J_z⟩, and visualizes signatures of time-translation symmetry breaking in dissipative quantum spin models.
